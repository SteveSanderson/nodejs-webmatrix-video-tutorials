To get started:

1. First use WebMatrix 2 to create a new Node.js project. This is purely to ensure you have Node.js and NPM installed already.
2. Open a new command prompt and change directory to the folder this file (readme.txt) is in
3. Use NPM to download all the packages this project requires by running this command:
   npm install
4. Once the packages are downloaded, open the project in WebMatrix 2.
   a) Start WebMatrix 2
   b) Choose "Open Site"
   c) Choose "Folder as Site"
   d) Choose this folder (the one containing readme.txt)
5. Launch the project by clicking "Run" in the top-left corner
